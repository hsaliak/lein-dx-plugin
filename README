# dx

A plugin for leiningen to work with android

## Installation
Build the project as per normal with lein
Install the plugin into ~/.lein/plugins/ 
TODO: Put this into clojars when its decent.
run lein help, you should see a lein dx.

## Usage
Create a normal project, run lein dx after you compile the project. 
The following variables in the defproject expression are respected for now:

:android-platform-tooldir "Path to android tools"

eg:
(defproject example  "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :description "FIXME: write"
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.2.0"]
                 [org.clojure/clojure-contrib "1.2.0"]]
  :dev-dependencies [[swank-clojure "1.2.0"]]
  :android-platform-tooldir "/home/johndough/android-sdk-linux_x86/platforms/android-8/tools"
  :main example.core
  )


Right now the plugin can run dex over your classfiles so they can run on an android, it does not give you full toolchain functionality so its not very useful.

The generated jar file that can be dropped into the emulator and run will be called $projectname-android.jar
